# Responsible Disclosure Statement

The security of our systems is top priority. No  matter how much effort we put into system security, there might be  vulnerabilities present. If you discover a vulnerability, we would like  to know about it so we can take steps to address it. We would like to  ask you to help us protect our users and our systems.

## Please do the following:

At this point in time - there is not yet an EHN (eHealth) network wide reporting facility that is secure. You have two options

First - you can email the eHEALTH-NETWORK Secretariat <eHEALTH-NETWORK@ec.europa.eu>. And they will then distribute it to the technical team or to the right contry contact.

For thigns that you want to report secure - you can, for now, submit your findings via the Dutch Government GOV-CERT:

        https://www.ncsc.nl/contact/kwetsbaarheid-melden

And reference the "MinVWS/CIO-office, Corona security response" in your report. And they will pass it on to the Europan Commission or to the right country.

Please do not publicly disclose these details without contacting us first. In return we will
investigate all received vulnerability reports and, where needed, will take appropriate action
as soon as is warranted. 

In most cases this will be a workaround/mitigation first, followed by a fix
and finally a public disclosure (and CVE number/report at MITRE).

## Do's:

- Report the vulnerability as quickly as is reasonably possible, to minimise the risk of hostile actors finding it and taking advantage of  it.
- Report in a manner that safeguards the confidentiality of the report so that others do not gain access to the information.
- Provide sufficient information to reproduce the problem, so we will  be able to resolve it. Usually, the IP address or the URL of the  affected system and a description of the vulnerability will be  sufficient. But complex vulnerabilities may require further explanation.

## Don'ts:

- Reveal the vulnerability or problem to others until it is resolved.
- Build your own backdoor in an information system with the intention  of then using it to demonstrate the vulnerability, because doing so can  cause additional damage and create unnecessary security risks.
- Utilise a vulnerability further than necessary to establish its existence.
- Copy, modify or delete data on the system. An alternative for doing so is making a directory listing of the system.
- Make changes to the system.
- Repeatedly gain access to the system or sharing access with others.
- Use brute force attacks, attacks on physical security, social  engineering, distributed denial of service, spam or applications of  third parties to gain access to the system.

## What we promise (see https://www.ncsc.nl/ for full details):

- We strive to respond to your report within 1 business days with our evaluation of the report and an expected resolution date. We will adhere to the NCSC.nl policy of a 60 day disclose and publish. 
- If you have followed the instructions above, we will not take any legal action against you concerning the report.
- We will not pass on your personal details to third parties without your permission, unless it is necessary to comply with a legal  obligation. Reporting under a pseudonym or anonymous is possible.
- We will keep you informed of the progress towards resolving the problem.
- In the public information concerning the reported problem, we will  give your name as the discoverer of the problem (unless you desire  otherwise).

We strive to resolve all problems as quickly as possible, and we would like to play an active role in the ultimate publication on the  problem after it is resolved.
